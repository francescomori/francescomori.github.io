# Vesuvius Challenge

## Vesuvius Challenge

Outside of my research, Iâ€™m also working part-time on the [Vesuvius Challenge](https://github.com/vesuviuschallenge). This project aims to decode ancient texts that were buried in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. I'm contributing by applying machine learning techniques to help unravel these long-lost writings.

You can learn more about the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/vesuviuschallenge).
