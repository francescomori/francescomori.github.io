I am an independent postdoctoral fellow ([Leverhulme-Peierls Fellow](https://www.leverhulmepeierlsfellows.com/profiles)) at the [Rudolf Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics, University of Oxford](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/subdepartment/rudolf-peierls-centre-theoretical-physics) and a Junior Research Fellow at [New College](https://www.new.ox.ac.uk). I am interested in nonequilibrium statistical physics, active matter, and learning. In particular, I am currently applying ideas from control theory to investigate optimal learning in artificial and biological systems.
