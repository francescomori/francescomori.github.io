I am a Research Associate at the [Harvard Center of Mathematical Sciences and Applications](https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu). My research spans nonequilibrium statistical physics, active matter, animal navigation, and machine learning. 

Previously, I was a [Leverhulme-Peierls Fellow](https://www.leverhulmepeierlsfellows.com/), at the [Rudolf Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics, University of Oxford](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/subdepartment/rudolf-peierls-centre-theoretical-physics) and a Junior Research Fellow at [New College](https://www.new.ox.ac.uk). 

You can view my [CV here](/files/Mori_CV.pdf) and my publications in my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3PbdntYAAAAJ&hl=it).
