# Welcome to My Academic Website

I am a Leverhulme-Peierls Fellow at the Rudolf Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics, University of Oxford and a Junior Research Fellow at New College. I am interested in nonequilibrium statistical physics, active matter, and learning. In particular, I am currently combining ideas from statistical physics and control theory to investigate optimal learning in artificial and biological systems.
