I am a [Leverhulme-Peierls Fellow](https://www.leverhulmepeierlsfellows.com/), working independently at the [Rudolf Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics, University of Oxford](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/subdepartment/rudolf-peierls-centre-theoretical-physics) and a Junior Research Fellow at [New College](https://www.new.ox.ac.uk). My research spans nonequilibrium statistical physics, active matter, animal navigation, and machine learning.
