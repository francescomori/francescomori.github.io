## Vesuvius Challenge

The **Vesuvius Challenge** is an exciting project focused on deciphering the ancient Herculaneum scrolls that were buried during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. These scrolls have remained unreadable for centuries. The challenge aims to unlock the texts using advanced scanning technologies and computational methods.

As part of my work on this project, I am applying techniques from **Statistical Physics**, including **Generalized Potts Model** and the **Belief Propagation Algorithm**, to help with the segmentation of 3D scans of the scrolls. 

If youâ€™re interested in the technical details of my contribution, you can explore my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/francescomori/ThaumatoAnakalyptor/tree/main/ThaumatoAnakalyptor/BP_node_deactivation).
